# MetalDocs roadmap

## Current state

```text
REPOSITORY MODE       CLEAN-SLATE / ARCHITECTURE-FIRST
T1 → T10              CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED / INTEGRATED
T11                   OPEN / ACTIVE
T11 checkpoint        B01-B10 ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T11 current block     B11 ACCESS ADMINISTRATION / OPEN / ACTIVE
METHODOLOGY ADOPTION  ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T12                   NOT OPEN
IMPLEMENTATION         BLOCKED
```

Current Product/architecture authority lives in `docs/product/**`, `docs/architecture/**`, and `docs/decisions/**`.

Current system census:

```text
semantic owners                  4 business + 2 supporting
stable SPA routes                11
PermissionCode values            16
application operations           89
Idempotency-Key creations        11
ETag read / mutation domains     13 / 13
exact-byte resources             4
```

`docs/decisions/api-operation-census.md` owns the current application-operation / Idempotency / ETag / exact-byte census.

## Organizational methodology baseline

The exact accepted organizational methodology pin and method-selection route are owned by `AGENTS.md`. Method selection starts at that pin's `ROUTER.md`.

The reusable local Frontend Product Experience Planning Method v2.3 was superseded by the central `FRONTEND-METHOD.md`, whose lineage explicitly consolidates the MetalDocs v2.3 generation. MetalDocs-specific P8 rendered-Evidence handling remains local in `docs/development/engineering-rules.md`.

Adoption impact sweep at integration time:

```text
B01-B09 protected structure / Screen Contracts  UNAFFECTED
Product/backend authority                       UNAFFECTED
89-operation / 11-route census                  UNAFFECTED
exact P8 LOCK Evidence                           UNAFFECTED
FP2 / P11                                        NOT OPEN
B10-B12                                          NOT OPEN at methodology-adoption integration
```

The independent methodology-adoption review converged with `MATERIAL=0` and `IMPORTANT=0`. Methodology adoption did not reopen Product/architecture/frontend LOCKs and did not authorize implementation.

Aggregate verification enforces the concrete bootstrap properties it owns, including the exact AGENTS methodology pin/ROUTER presence, context budget, temporary-work hygiene, known local-method removal, active-router de-reference, and exact Evidence-ref protections. Broader semantic duplicate-authority defects remain hard stops/review concerns rather than falsely claimed as exhaustively grep-detectable.

## Frontend Product Experience Program

```text
FP0  Frontend Foundation                         CLOSED / 89 operations / 11 routes REBASELINED
FP1  Block-by-block Product Experience           ACTIVE
FP2  Integrated Low-Fidelity Product / P11       NOT OPEN
FP3  Whole-Product Adversarial Review / P12      NOT OPEN
FP4  Visual Handoff + Readiness / P13-P14        NOT OPEN
```

Exact locked frontend Evidence remains recoverable through:

```text
B01-B09
docs/decisions/t11-b01-b09-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr162-b01-b09-locks-20260824
→ adf58e448bc5bd3a20cae5b7228d729c031f94ac

B10
docs/decisions/t11-b10-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr170-b10-locks-20260824
→ b8c607cbd30d61d6bcf6ec1ea734ed1653d2569e
```

Both Evidence refs are exact-SHA checked and non-authoritative. B10 `docs/work/**` is absent from integrated `main` after exact Evidence preservation.

## Exact next action

```text
1. Operator operates the exact B11 P8 artifact at docs/work/current/t11-b11-access-administration-p8.html; only the operator may LOCK.
2. Explicitly test B11-A1 by locating the later-page Group `Segurança Operacional`, User `Mariana Costa`, Area `Jurídico` and RoleAssignment `A-017` without fake global search/filter and judge browse sufficiency.
3. Explicitly test B11-A2 by adding/removing Mariana from a security-bearing Group and judge whether bounded consequence language is sufficient without a complete effective-access projection.
4. Explicitly test B11-A3 by granting/revoking access while direct and Group-mediated paths can coexist and judge whether safe administration is possible without a separate access-explanation surface.
5. Exercise fixed Role meaning, Subject × Role × Scope review, Company/Area scope restrictions, ambiguous createRoleAssignment retry with the same logical command/Idempotency-Key, and 403/404/409/422 states.
6. If operator/P8 Evidence proves current authority materially insufficient, STOP only the affected B11 scope and route the smallest UPSTREAM FINDING; do not invent search/filter/effective-access/explanation authority in the browser.
7. If disposition REVISE, revise P8 and repeat affected walkthrough. Only after explicit B11 LOCK run P9 bidirectional trace and P10 bounded pattern consolidation.
8. docs/work/** must be absent from the eventual B11 merge candidate/main after exact Evidence preservation.
9. B12 and FP2/P11 remain NOT OPEN. T12 and Product implementation remain BLOCKED.
```

## Hard stops

```text
no Product code/schema/OpenAPI/runtime/deploy implementation
no T12 work
no B12 work
no FP2/P11 work
no B01-B10 reopen without material Evidence
no invented B11 search/filter/effective-access/explanation API for UI convenience
no client-side fake global search over a loaded page
no frontend effective-permission authority or inferred inherited-access matrix
no custom Role/Permission editor
no assistant/reviewer LOCK
no local reusable methodology fork
no floating methodology main as normative authority
no methodology sync bot/submodule/generated copies/framework
no merge without explicit operator authorization
```

## Implementation gate

Implementation remains blocked until:

```text
T11 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
T12 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
Integrated Whole-R10 coherence = PASS
fresh independent challenge = converged
operator implementation authorization = explicit
```

Accepted Product/R10/frontend LOCK decisions reopen only on material Evidence under the pinned DevelopmentConexus Engineering Method; methodology-migration ceremony alone is not a reopen trigger.
