# MetalDocs roadmap

## Current state

```text
REPOSITORY MODE       CLEAN-SLATE / ARCHITECTURE-FIRST
T1 → T10              CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED / INTEGRATED
T11                   OPEN / ACTIVE
T11 checkpoint        B01-B09 ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T11 current block     B10 ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATION / OPEN / ACTIVE
METHODOLOGY ADOPTION  ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T12                   NOT OPEN
IMPLEMENTATION         BLOCKED
```

Current Product/architecture authority lives in `docs/product/**`, `docs/architecture/**`, and `docs/decisions/**`.

Current system census:

```text
semantic owners                  4 business + 2 supporting
stable SPA routes                11
PermissionCode values            16
application operations           89
Idempotency-Key creations        11
ETag read / mutation domains     13 / 13
exact-byte resources             4
```

`docs/decisions/api-operation-census.md` owns the current application-operation / Idempotency / ETag / exact-byte census.

## Organizational methodology baseline

The exact accepted organizational methodology pin and method-selection route are owned by `AGENTS.md`. Method selection starts at that pin's `ROUTER.md`.

The reusable local Frontend Product Experience Planning Method v2.3 was superseded by the central `FRONTEND-METHOD.md`, whose lineage explicitly consolidates the MetalDocs v2.3 generation. MetalDocs-specific P8 rendered-Evidence handling remains local in `docs/development/engineering-rules.md`.

Adoption impact sweep at integration time:

```text
B01-B09 protected structure / Screen Contracts  UNAFFECTED
Product/backend authority                       UNAFFECTED
89-operation / 11-route census                  UNAFFECTED
exact P8 LOCK Evidence                           UNAFFECTED
FP2 / P11                                        NOT OPEN
B10-B12                                          NOT OPEN at methodology-adoption integration
```

The independent methodology-adoption review converged with `MATERIAL=0` and `IMPORTANT=0`. Methodology adoption did not reopen Product/architecture/frontend LOCKs and did not authorize implementation.

Aggregate verification enforces the concrete bootstrap properties it owns, including the exact AGENTS methodology pin/ROUTER presence, context budget, temporary-work hygiene, known local-method removal, active-router de-reference, and existing exact Evidence-ref protections. Broader semantic duplicate-authority defects remain hard stops/review concerns rather than falsely claimed as exhaustively grep-detectable.

## Frontend Product Experience Program

```text
FP0  Frontend Foundation                         CLOSED / 89 operations / 11 routes REBASELINED
FP1  Block-by-block Product Experience           ACTIVE
FP2  Integrated Low-Fidelity Product / P11       NOT OPEN
FP3  Whole-Product Adversarial Review / P12      NOT OPEN
FP4  Visual Handoff + Readiness / P13-P14        NOT OPEN
```

## FP1 block status

```text
B01   App Shell + Global IA + Home                 LOCKED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED

       unresolved BLOCKING / IMPORTANT             0 / 0
B10   Organization Administration                  OPEN / ACTIVE / P7 CANDIDATE OPERATOR-APPROVED

B11   Access Administration                        NOT OPEN
B12   Document Governance Administration           NOT OPEN
```

Exact locked B01-B09 P8 identities remain recoverable through:

```text
docs/decisions/t11-b01-b09-lock-evidence.md

evidence/t11-pr162-b01-b09-locks-20260824
→ adf58e448bc5bd3a20cae5b7228d729c031f94ac
```

The Evidence ref remains exact-SHA checked and non-authoritative.

## Exact next action

```text
1. Continue only B10 — Organization Administration from the operator-approved P7 candidate.
2. Materialize browser-operable functional P8 low-fidelity Evidence under docs/work/current/*.html only.
3. Preserve B10-A1 as falsifiable: do not fake global search by filtering only a loaded page and do not invent an API merely for screen convenience.
4. If operator/P8 Evidence proves paginated browse materially insufficient, STOP only affected B10 scope and route the smallest UPSTREAM FINDING before continuing.
5. Operator operates the P8 artifact; only the operator may LOCK. Assistant/reviewer may propose REVISE/FINDING but not LOCK.
6. After explicit B10 LOCK, run P9 bidirectional trace and P10 bounded pattern consolidation before preparing the B10 acceptance candidate.
7. docs/work/** must be absent from the eventual merge candidate/main.
8. B11-B12 and FP2/P11 remain NOT OPEN. T12 and Product implementation remain BLOCKED.
```

## Hard stops

```text
no Product code/schema/OpenAPI/runtime/deploy implementation
no T12 work
no B11-B12 work
no FP2/P11 work
no B01-B09 reopen without material Evidence
no invented B10 search/filter/read API for UI convenience
no local reusable methodology fork
no floating methodology main as normative authority
no methodology sync bot/submodule/generated copies/framework
```

## Implementation gate

Implementation remains blocked until:

```text
T11 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
T12 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
Integrated Whole-R10 coherence = PASS
fresh independent challenge = converged
operator implementation authorization = explicit
```

Accepted Product/R10/frontend LOCK decisions reopen only on material Evidence under the pinned DevelopmentConexus Engineering Method; methodology-migration ceremony alone is not a reopen trigger.
