# MetalDocs roadmap

## Current state

```text
REPOSITORY MODE       CLEAN-SLATE / ARCHITECTURE-FIRST
T1 → T10              CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED / INTEGRATED
T11                   OPEN / ACTIVE
T11 checkpoint        B01-B10 ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T11 current block     B11 ACCESS ADMINISTRATION / OPEN / ACTIVE
METHODOLOGY ADOPTION  ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
T12                   NOT OPEN
IMPLEMENTATION         BLOCKED
```

Current Product/architecture authority lives in `docs/product/**`, `docs/architecture/**`, and `docs/decisions/**`.

Current system census:

```text
semantic owners                  4 business + 2 supporting
stable SPA routes                11
PermissionCode values            16
application operations           89
Idempotency-Key creations        11
ETag read / mutation domains     13 / 13
exact-byte resources             4
```

`docs/decisions/api-operation-census.md` owns the current application-operation / Idempotency / ETag / exact-byte census.

## Organizational methodology baseline

The exact accepted organizational methodology pin and method-selection route are owned by `AGENTS.md`. Method selection starts at that pin's `ROUTER.md`.

The reusable local Frontend Product Experience Planning Method v2.3 was superseded by the central `FRONTEND-METHOD.md`, whose lineage explicitly consolidates the MetalDocs v2.3 generation. MetalDocs-specific P8 rendered-Evidence handling remains local in `docs/development/engineering-rules.md`.

Adoption impact sweep at integration time:

```text
B01-B09 protected structure / Screen Contracts  UNAFFECTED
Product/backend authority                       UNAFFECTED
89-operation / 11-route census                  UNAFFECTED
exact P8 LOCK Evidence                           UNAFFECTED
FP2 / P11                                        NOT OPEN
B10-B12                                          NOT OPEN at methodology-adoption integration
```

The independent methodology-adoption review converged with `MATERIAL=0` and `IMPORTANT=0`. Methodology adoption did not reopen Product/architecture/frontend LOCKs and did not authorize implementation.

Aggregate verification enforces the concrete bootstrap properties it owns, including the exact AGENTS methodology pin/ROUTER presence, context budget, temporary-work hygiene, known local-method removal, active-router de-reference, and exact Evidence-ref protections. Broader semantic duplicate-authority defects remain hard stops/review concerns rather than falsely claimed as exhaustively grep-detectable.

## Frontend Product Experience Program

```text
FP0  Frontend Foundation                         CLOSED / 89 operations / 11 routes REBASELINED

FP2  Integrated Low-Fidelity Product / P11       NOT OPEN
FP3  Whole-Product Adversarial Review / P12      NOT OPEN
FP4  Visual Handoff + Readiness / P13-P14        NOT OPEN
```

Exact locked frontend Evidence remains recoverable through:

```text
B01-B09
docs/decisions/t11-b01-b09-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr162-b01-b09-locks-20260824
→ adf58e448bc5bd3a20cae5b7228d729c031f94ac

B10
docs/decisions/t11-b10-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr170-b10-locks-20260824
→ b8c607cbd30d61d6bcf6ec1ea734ed1653d2569e
```

Both Evidence refs are exact-SHA checked and non-authoritative. B10 `docs/work/**` is absent from integrated `main` after exact Evidence preservation.

## Exact next action

```text
1. Operator reviews the exact written B11 P6/P7 specification at docs/work/current/t11-b11-access-administration-p6-p7.md.
2. Do not begin P8 until the operator explicitly approves that written specification.
3. After written-spec approval, materialize browser-operable functional P8 low-fidelity Evidence under docs/work/current/*.html only.
4. P8 must actively falsify B11-A1 findability, B11-A2 membership-consequence sufficiency, and B11-A3 access-explanation sufficiency; do not fake global search, complete effective access, or access explanation in the browser.
5. If P8/operator Evidence proves current authority insufficient, STOP only the affected B11 scope and route the smallest UPSTREAM FINDING before continuing.
6. Operator operates P8; only the operator may LOCK. After explicit B11 LOCK, run P9 bidirectional trace and P10 bounded pattern consolidation.
7. docs/work/** must be absent from the eventual B11 merge candidate/main after exact Evidence preservation.
8. B12 and FP2/P11 remain NOT OPEN. T12 and Product implementation remain BLOCKED.
```

## Hard stops

```text
no Product code/schema/OpenAPI/runtime/deploy implementation
no T12 work
no B12 work
no FP2/P11 work
no B01-B10 reopen without material Evidence
no invented B11 search/filter/effective-access/explanation API for UI convenience
no client-side fake global search over a loaded page
no frontend effective-permission authority or inferred inherited-access matrix
no custom Role/Permission editor
no assistant/reviewer LOCK
no local reusable methodology fork
no floating methodology main as normative authority
no methodology sync bot/submodule/generated copies/framework
no merge without explicit operator authorization
```

## Implementation gate

Implementation remains blocked until:

```text
T11 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
T12 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
Integrated Whole-R10 coherence = PASS
fresh independent challenge = converged
operator implementation authorization = explicit
```

Accepted Product/R10/frontend LOCK decisions reopen only on material Evidence under the pinned DevelopmentConexus Engineering Method; methodology-migration ceremony alone is not a reopen trigger.
