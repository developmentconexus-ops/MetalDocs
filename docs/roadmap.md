# MetalDocs roadmap

## Current state

```text
REPOSITORY MODE       CLEAN-SLATE / ARCHITECTURE-FIRST
T1 → T10              CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED / INTEGRATED
T11                   OPEN / ACTIVE
T11 checkpoint        B01-B10 ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED
LOCAL METHODS         RESTORED / ENGINEERING v1.0.0 + FRONTEND v2.3
T12                   NOT OPEN
IMPLEMENTATION         BLOCKED
```

Current Product/architecture authority lives in `docs/product/**`, `docs/architecture/**`, and `docs/decisions/**`.

Current system census:

```text
semantic owners                  4 business + 2 supporting
stable SPA routes                11
PermissionCode values            16
application operations           89
Idempotency-Key creations        11
ETag read / mutation domains     13 / 13
exact-byte resources             4
```

`docs/decisions/api-operation-census.md` owns the current application-operation / Idempotency / ETag / exact-byte census.

## Local methodology baseline

MetalDocs uses the repository-local shared method files:

```text
docs/development/engineering-method.md
  DevelopmentConexus Engineering Method v1.0.0

docs/development/frontend-product-experience-planning-method.md
  Frontend Product Experience Planning Method v2.3
```

Both files are the unchanged previously accepted methods also used by the other DevelopmentConexus product repositories. There is no external methodology router/pin in the active operating path.

Restoring the local methods changes operating mechanics only. It does not reopen Product/architecture/frontend decisions and does not authorize implementation.

```text
B01-B10 protected structure / Screen Contracts  UNAFFECTED
Product/backend authority                       UNAFFECTED
89-operation / 11-route census                  UNAFFECTED
exact P8 LOCK Evidence                          UNAFFECTED
FP2 / P11                                        NOT OPEN
B11-B12                                          NOT OPEN
```

Required CI is intentionally limited to objective repository properties. Global Maximum, UX/architecture quality, evidence sufficiency, repository-reading depth, and methodology reasoning are review/method concerns rather than grep-based CI assertions.

## Frontend Product Experience Program

```text
FP0  Frontend Foundation                         CLOSED / 89 operations / 11 routes REBASELINED
FP1  Block-by-block Product Experience           ACTIVE
FP2  Integrated Low-Fidelity Product / P11       NOT OPEN
FP3  Whole-Product Adversarial Review / P12      NOT OPEN
FP4  Visual Handoff + Readiness / P13-P14        NOT OPEN
```

Exact locked frontend Evidence remains recoverable through:

```text
B01-B09
docs/decisions/t11-b01-b09-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr162-b01-b09-locks-20260824
→ adf58e448bc5bd3a20cae5b7228d729c031f94ac

B10
docs/decisions/t11-b10-lock-evidence.md
evidence/t11-pr170-b10-locks-20260824
→ b8c607cbd30d61d6bcf6ec1ea734ed1653d2569e
```

The Evidence refs are non-authoritative recovery/provenance inputs. B10 `docs/work/**` is absent from integrated `main` after exact Evidence preservation.

## Exact next action

```text
1. Revalidate accepted main and recover current authority through AGENTS → docs/roadmap plus useful routes in docs/index.
2. Use local engineering-method.md + frontend-product-experience-planning-method.md for the next frontend-planning increment.
3. Revalidate all Product/architecture/Evidence context that can materially affect B11 before deciding whether B11 is ready to open.
4. Do not treat B11 as opened merely because B10 is integrated.
5. T11 remains OPEN; B11-B12 remain NOT OPEN until explicitly opened by a later acceptance increment.
6. FP2/P11 remains NOT OPEN until the block program reaches its accepted assembly boundary.
7. T12 and Product implementation remain BLOCKED.
```

## Hard stops

```text
no Product code/schema/OpenAPI/runtime/deploy implementation
no T12 work
no B11-B12 work until a later explicit acceptance increment opens it
no FP2/P11 work
no B01-B10 reopen without material Evidence
no invented B10 search/filter/read API for UI convenience
no assistant/reviewer LOCK
no ad-hoc local rewrite of the shared method files
no merge without explicit operator authorization
```

## Implementation gate

Implementation remains blocked until:

```text
T11 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
T12 CLOSED / OPERATOR-RATIFIED
Integrated Whole-R10 coherence = PASS
fresh independent challenge = converged
operator implementation authorization = explicit
```

Accepted Product/R10/frontend LOCK decisions reopen only on material Evidence under the DevelopmentConexus Engineering Method; methodology-storage changes alone are not a reopen trigger.
